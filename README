= Rushmate

Rushmate attempts to make Textmate (http://macromates.com) custom command writing in ruby cleaner and smaller.  It does this by leveraging rush (http://rush.heroku.com/).

== Dependencies

* Rush

== Install

gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install schlueter-rushmate

== Sample

After installing rushmate.  You would make a command in Textmate with the following text.

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rushmate'
Rushmate::Command.new {
  # find ruby files with the current word in textmate
  found_files = tm_project_directory["**/#{tm_current_word.downcase}.rb"]
  if found_files.empty?
    # if you can't find any files show a tool tip
    exit.show_tool_tip("can't find #{tm_current_word.downcase}.rb in project")
  else
    # go ahead and switch to the found file(s)
    found_files.mate
  end
}
