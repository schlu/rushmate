= Rushmate

Rushmate attempts to make Textmate (http://macromates.com) custom command writing in ruby cleaner and smaller.  It does this by leveraging rush (http://rush.heroku.com/).

== Dependencies

* Rush

== Install

gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
sudo gem install schlueter-rushmate

== Sample

After installing rushmate.  You would make a command in Textmate with the following text.

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'rushmate'
Rushmate::Command.new {
  # find ruby files with the current word in textmate
  found_files = project_directory["**/#{current_word.downcase}.rb"]
  if found_files.empty?
    # if you can't find any files show a tool tip
    exit.show_tool_tip("can't find #{current_word.downcase}.rb in project")
  else
    if found_files.size == 1
      # if there is only 1 file go ahead and switch to that file
      found_files.mate
    else
      # if there are multiple files prompt the user for which file they want to switch to 
      # then switch to their selection
      menu_files = found_files.collect { |f| f.full_path.gsub(project_directory.full_path, "") }
      project_directory[user_input.quick_menu_from_array(menu_files)].mate
    end
  end
}
